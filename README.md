I was just learning about flexbox before starting this, so i spent such a ridiculous amount of time trying to force flex to work on a single element for no reason. Eventually I had to look to w3 for help with verticle alignment. Probably wildly over complicated the positioning in css, but hey it works.

For a while I was convinced my eyes were playing tricks on me with that nearly transparent super soft shadow, didn't even know box shadow could do that. Used a cool tool to actually get the values: https://htmlcssfreebies.com/soft-border-box-shadow/

The initial mock up of the card itself came together super quick, and although I don't think it's perfect I'm pretty surprised how well this came together.
